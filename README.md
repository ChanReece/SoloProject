## Setup: 
- Install VS Code
- Install Node
- Install Gasket
- Commit initial code to a directory under `Teams` with your team name.

## Instructions
The goal of this project is to build a Node/REACT application allowing your customers to do a domain search. To begin make sure you have followed the setup steps above.

Next build your search page to look and function like this examle running app:

https://cart.test-godaddy.com/cdn/fos/react/domain-search/

It should consist of:
- Search component
  - Takes input
  - Handles search errors
- Results componenet
  - Returns results with prices like example does
  - Handles no results found
  - Handles errors

Styling is up to you as the design and development team to determine how you create this to look similar or even better if you have the time and want to expand on it. We would recommend using inline styles to start but feel free to branch out to other solutions if you want to as time permits
